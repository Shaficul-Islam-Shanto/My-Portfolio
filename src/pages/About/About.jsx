              I'm <strong>Shaficul Islam Shanto</strong>, a passionate Frontend Developer with a
              background in Mathematics. I started my programming journey in college,
              exploring how websites work and fell in love with React. I enjoy building clean,
              interactive UIs and solving real-world problems with code.

              I love working on modern web technologies and constantly learning new tools.
              Outside of programming, Iâ€™m involved in the development sector as a volunteer,
              and I also enjoy working with youth communities and the Bangladesh Scouts.
